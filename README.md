# grouphub

## globals

/!\ Too Slow /!\

Group repository by using this extention and defining your own implementation of `https://github.com/{user_name}/grouphub.public/config.json`

- your groups are accessible by this public repo and private repo's, name will be known unless you use `grouphub.private` (need credential, not working for now)
- this repository is scan by the extention for any user/org and it's a way to share in better way your related project

Example https://github.com/P-E-R-R-Y/grouphub.public

## install extention

chromium: (brave):

- open `brave://extensions/`
- activate `developer mode`
- clone repo
- `load unpacked`
- select this git repo

## notices

- update in *grouphub.public* can take up to 5minutes to update extension value due to caching.
- the best way of providing faster & smarter usage is by the usage of api key. (which is not user friendy)

## improve:
- window.load -> find a better way to load groups faster.
- make it work in private mode with credential.
